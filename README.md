# Country-quiz

This is a web game taken from [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/) ðŸ•¹


## Features
 - Using promises, it fetches data using the **REST Countries API**.

 - It randomly selects one country out of every single one received in JSON and one out of three types of questions available for the game.

 - It formulates the question with the chosen country, and it choses another 3 countries that are wrong answers.

 - It randomly prints these 4 countries into the game.

 - If you click the right answer, you gain 1 point and repeat the process. Your points get restarted when you lose.

 - **Extra**: It encapsulates the selected country and the type of question in a closure instead of having them in the global scope, just to be sure to not letting cheating so easy..
